Cloudera Operational Database is a Cloudera on cloud service for
self-service creation of an operational database.

Cloudera Operational Database on cloud is designed to be used by developers. You
do not need a dedicated team of system administrators to run an
on-premise cluster of physical servers. You can go directly to Cloudera and
provision a new database, therefore letting you rapidly prototype and
deploy new applications in the cloud.
