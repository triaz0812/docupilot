Cloudera Data Hub is a service for launching and managing workload clusters. Cloudera Data
Hub provides a set of default cluster definitions and templates that
allow you to quickly provision workload clusters for prescriptive use
cases, such as Data Engineering or Flow Management. Through Cloudera Data Hub and
Cloudera Manager you can also access and manage the clusters that you
create.



* **Cluster deployment:**
  Currently, you can deploy Cloudera Data Hub clusters on
  AWS,
  Azure,
  or GCP.
  Deploying a Cloudera Data Hub cluster requires that you have a cloud provider
  account with either AWS, Azure or GCP; an environment registered in Cloudera; and
  a cloud credential. You can learn more about these specific requirements
  in the
  Cloudera Management Console documentation.
* **Cluster configuration:**
  You can easily create a Cloudera Data Hub cluster from a
  default cluster configuration,
  or you can create your own custom cluster configurations. Data Hub
  clusters are powered by Cloudera Runtime and Cloudera DataFlow
  components, and the
  Cloudera Runtime
  and
  DataFlow for Data Hub
  documentation contain more information about individual cluster services.
* **Cluster access and management:**
  After you create a Cloudera Data Hub cluster, you can
  access cluster web UIs and endpoints
  through the Data Hub page of the Cloudera UI. Through the UI you can also
  perform most
  cluster management tasks,
  such as resizing, stopping, or restarting a cluster, as well as stopping
  and restarting cluster services. Certain cluster management,
  configuration, and monitoring functions are performed through the
  Cloudera Manager
  Admin Console, which is accessible from Cloudera Data Hub.
* **Running workload clusters:**
  Once your cluster is up and running and you can access it, refer to
  Cloudera Runtime or Cloudera DataFlow for Data Hub documentation for
  information about running workload clusters
  using services such as Hive, Spark, Impala, Hue, or Kafka.
* **API, CLI and SDK:**
  The Cloudera Control Plane provides
  API,
  CLI
  and
  SDK
  tools that you can use to script and automate certain Cloudera Data Hub cluster
  creation and management tasks.

in-depth overview.
