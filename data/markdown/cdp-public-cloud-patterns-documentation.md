## What are CDP Patterns?

CDP Patterns are end-to-end product integrations, providing validated,
reusable solution patterns that expedite delivery of your business use
cases. They are intended to provide a reusable architecture for solving
common problems.

## What problems do CDP Patterns solve?

CDP Patterns provide tested cross-component integration to support your
operation objectives across the data life cycle, from data collection
and ingestion to predictive analytics and visualizations. Patterns are
intended to improve onboarding and time to value by simplifying user
experience and technical documentation.

Cloudera provides patterns based on common customer use cases
including the following:

* Scalable Self-Service Analytics
* Business Intelligence at Scale (Technical Preview)
* Exploratory Data Science
* Real Time Operational Insights (coming soon)
